# REGISTERS:

I have compiled data on all of the relevant registers for tap detection using the IMU

Note: "Info" is what the values represent, "Details" is what the register controls, "Hexadeciaml Address" is the address of the register
Note (cont.): "Page No." is the page that has the details of the register in the datasheet, "Default Value" is what the default value of the register is
Note (cont.): "Relevant Bits" are all of bits that are relevant to tap detection

# WAKE_UP_THS:
1. Hexadecimal Address: 5B
2. Page No. 66
3. Relevant Bits: 0
4. Details: single/double tap select
5. Default Value: 0
6. Info: 0 - Single tap detection only, 1 - Single and Double tap detection

# INT_DUR2:
not able to fill in yet, will fill in later
